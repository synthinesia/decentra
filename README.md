## Structure
- Papersheets (texts, research) is in folder papers
- Code in any language (tests, benchmarks, small apps) in folder code, make sure every code has own subfolder
- Big apps, games are in apps, own subfolder 
## How it works there
- You can read everything, make your own projects/papers, just don't stole others ideas. If you want to use their idea and make some change to that idea, mark the original creator.
- Commits are not direct, will be processed with look on rules. Encrypted files are not allowed.
